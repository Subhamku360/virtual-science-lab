# Virtual Science Lab

Welcome to the Virtual Science Lab, an immersive web application designed to simulate a chemistry laboratory experience. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, this project aims to provide an interactive and educational platform for exploring chemical experiments.

## Features

*   **Interactive Landing Page:** A modern entry point featuring a dynamic particle animation background.
*   **Simulated Lab Environment:** Enter a dedicated interface representing the laboratory space.
*   **Experiment Simulation:** Select and initiate various chemistry experiments (currently includes Electrolysis and Acid-Base Neutralization).
*   **Detailed Experiment Information:** Access comprehensive details for each experiment, including:
    *   Chemical reactions
    *   Safety precautions
    *   Step-by-step procedures
    *   Underlying scientific theory
*   **Custom Loading Animations:** Enjoy unique visual feedback when starting specific experiments (e.g., bubbling electrodes for electrolysis, pouring liquids for neutralization).
*   **Smooth Transitions:** Seamless cross-fade animations between the landing page and the main lab interface enhance user experience.
*   **Modern Styling:** A clean and responsive interface styled using Tailwind CSS.
*   **Ambient Sound:** Subtle lab sounds contribute to the immersive atmosphere.

## Tech Stack
